# DeadCraft
Deadcraft aims to be a basic Zombie Apocalypse

Deadcraft is a thrilling survival mod where bloodbecomes your greatest enemy...

When you start bleeding, you'll leave a trail of blood splatters that draw in every undead mob within a 64-block radius. Bandages are your lifeline, providing a quick way to stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of attracting nearby threats.

Build structures to keep out the dead...

You can craft wooden barricades, but be careful—they’ll apply the bleed effect if you run into them

But your first true challenge comes with the Horde Moon, an event where a swarm of zombies will hunt you relentlessly
